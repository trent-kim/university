The year ahead will challenge us with incredible obstacles not only academically, but also collectively. But as always we come together to embrace growth and radical empathy. As I think of our diverse, inclusive community, I am reminded of a quote by Buckminster Fuller: <br><br>“You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.”<br><br>And this holds true as our students, faculty, and staff continue to thrive and positively impact this complex society. Thank you all for your continually contribution to building the Wecair community and wealth.<br><br>Sincerely, <br>President Christina Somerson"
